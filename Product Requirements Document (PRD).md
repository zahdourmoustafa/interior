2.  **Frontend Request:** The Next.js frontend sends a tRPC request to a Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/generate-image`). This request includes the uploaded image (or a reference to it if already stored), room type, and selected styles.
3.  **Image Upload & Storage:** The API route first handles the upload of the original image to a cloud storage solution (e.g., Vercel Blob, AWS S3, or similar, depending on final architecture decision) and stores its URL in the Neon.tech database via Drizzle ORM.
4.  **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** The API route then calls the GPT API with the selected room type and style(s) to generate a highly optimized and detailed prompt for the image generation model. This prompt will emphasize 4K resolution and realism.
5.  **Replicate API Call:** The API route sends a request to the Replicate API, passing the original image URL, the dynamically generated prompt, and any other necessary parameters (e.g., model ID, aspect ratio).
6.  **AI Processing:** Replicate processes the request using the specified AI model.
7.  **Image Retrieval & Storage:** Once the AI model generates the new image(s), Replicate returns the URLs of the generated images. The API route then stores these URLs, along with the original image URL, room type, style, and the generated prompt, in the Neon.tech database.
8.  **Frontend Response:** The API route sends the URLs of the generated images back to the Next.js frontend.
9.  **Image Display:** The frontend displays the generated images in the designated right panel.
