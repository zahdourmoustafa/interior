## 🏗️ **Complete Architecture Implemented**

### **Core Components** ✅
- **Credit Counter** - Beautiful sidebar display with progress ring
- **Credit Context Provider** - Global state management with real-time updates
- **Upgrade Modal** - Professional upgrade prompt with plan selection
- **Credit Check Hook** - Easy integration for all generation components

### **Integration Pattern Applied** ✅
Each feature now follows the same pattern:
```typescript
// 1. Import credit hook
import { useCreditCheck } from '@/hooks/use-credit-check';

// 2. Initialize with feature type
const { checkAndConsumeCredit, UpgradeModalComponent } = useCreditCheck({
  feature: 'FEATURE_NAME',
  onSuccess: () => console.log('Credit consumed'),
  onError: (error) => handleError(error)
});

// 3. Check credits before generation
const hasCredits = await checkAndConsumeCredit(generationId, metadata);
if (!hasCredits) return;

// 4. Include modal in JSX
<UpgradeModalComponent />
```

### **Metadata Tracking** ✅
Each feature tracks relevant data:
- **Interior**: `{ roomType, designStyle, imageUrl, slot }`
- **Exterior**: `{ designStyle, imageUrl, slot }`
- **Sketch**: `{ roomType, designStyle, sketchUrl, slot }`
- **Furnish**: `{ roomType, furnishingStyle, imageUrl, slot }`
- **Remove**: `{ imageUrl, objectsToRemove, slot }`
- **Video**: `{ imageUrl, videoEffect, slot }`

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **Complete User Journey** ✅
1. **User sees credit counter** in sidebar (e.g., "3/6")
2. **User attempts generation** in any feature
3. **System checks credits** automatically
4. **If sufficient credits:**
   - Credit consumed (counter updates to "2/6")
   - Generation proceeds normally
   - Success toast with remaining credits
5. **If insufficient credits:**
   - Professional upgrade modal appears
   - Generation is blocked
   - Clear call-to-action to upgrade

### **Upgrade Flow** ✅
1. **Modal shows** when credits depleted
2. **Plan selection** with Basic/Pro/Expert options
3. **"Upgrade Now"** redirects to `/checkout?plan=selected`
4. **"Maybe Later"** closes modal gracefully
