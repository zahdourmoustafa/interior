# Upgrade Button Fix - Final Solution ✅

**Issue:** `showUpgradeModal is not a function` error when clicking upgrade button  
**Root Cause:** Wrong hook used for upgrade button functionality  
**Solution:** Direct UpgradeModal state management  
**Status:** FIXED  

---

## 🐛 **Error Details**

### **Console Error:**
```
sidebar.tsx:63 Uncaught TypeError: showUpgradeModal is not a function
    at handleUpgradeClick (sidebar.tsx:63:5)
    at onClick (credit-counter.tsx:179:21)
```

### **Root Cause:**
- **Wrong Hook:** Used `useCreditCheck` which doesn't have `showUpgradeModal`
- **Hook Mismatch:** `useCreditCheck` is for generation features, not upgrade buttons
- **Function Missing:** The function simply didn't exist in that hook

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Removed Hook Dependency**
Instead of using hooks with missing functions, implemented direct modal state management:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Using wrong hook
const { showUpgradeModal, UpgradeModalComponent } = useCreditCheck({
  feature: 'upgrade', // This doesn't work
});

// ✅ CORRECT: Direct state management
const [isUpgradeModalOpen, setIsUpgradeModalOpen] = useState(false);
```

### **2. Direct UpgradeModal Integration**
```typescript
const CreditCounterSidebar = ({ isExpanded }: { isExpanded: boolean }) => {
  const { credits, loading } = useCredits();
  const [isUpgradeModalOpen, setIsUpgradeModalOpen] = useState(false);
  
  const handleUpgradeClick = () => {
    setIsUpgradeModalOpen(true); // Simple state update
  };

  const handleCloseModal = () => {
    setIsUpgradeModalOpen(false);
  };

  const handleUpgrade = () => {
    // UpgradeModal handles the upgrade process internally
    setIsUpgradeModalOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <CreditCounter
        isExpanded={isExpanded}
        credits={credits}
        loading={loading}
        onUpgradeClick={handleUpgradeClick}
      />
      <UpgradeModal
        isOpen={isUpgradeModalOpen}
        onClose={handleCloseModal}
        onUpgrade={handleUpgrade}
        remainingCredits={credits?.remaining || 0}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

### **3. Updated Imports**
```typescript
import { useCredits } from '@/providers/credit-provider';
import { CreditCounter } from '@/components/sidebar/credit-counter';
import { UpgradeModal } from '@/components/modals/upgrade-modal';
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **User Flow:**
1. **User clicks upgrade button** in sidebar
2. **Modal state updates** → `setIsUpgradeModalOpen(true)`
3. **UpgradeModal renders** with pricing plans
4. **User selects plan** → Modal handles checkout internally
5. **Modal closes** after process starts

### **Technical Flow:**
1. **Button Click** → `handleUpgradeClick()` → `setIsUpgradeModalOpen(true)`
2. **Modal Opens** → `UpgradeModal` component renders
3. **Plan Selection** → Modal calls `/api/checkout` internally
4. **Checkout Process** → Redirects to Creem.io payment
5. **Modal Closes** → `handleUpgrade()` → `setIsUpgradeModalOpen(false)`

```
